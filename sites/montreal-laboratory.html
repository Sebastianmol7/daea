		 <h3>Historical Context</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>"Okay let's go." With these three simple words, the Minister of Canada's Wartime Department of Munitions and Supply, C.D. Howe, gave the famous go-ahead that entered Canada into the nuclear age. The Montreal Laboratory, setup in 1942 in a collaboration between Canadian and British scientists, established Canada's first Nuclear Research facility in Montreal, Quebec. Montreal Laboratory's research initially began in an old McGill University residence, but only three months later was moved to a new, larger building at the University of Montreal.</p>		

		 <h3>Controversy at Montréal Laboratory </h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Montréal Laboratory began with success, quickly making significant progress. The laboratory's staff, about half being Canadian, quickly grew to include over three hundred employees. Unfortunately, the staff became frustrated with the lack of cooperation with American scientists, as well as the France born Laboratory director, Hans von Halban, who the Americans saw as a security risk. As a result, the exchange of information between the Montreal Laboratory and the American scientists became much more restricted.</p>
		 <p>A year after the Montreal Laboratory was established, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt met in Quebec to discuss the unsatisfactory collaboration between British and American scientists in their work on Nuclear research, including their work at the Montreal Laboratory. This meeting became known as the "Quebec Agreement", setting out the terms that would later define Canada's role in the Manhattan project.</p>

         <h3>Further Research</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Jersey Cottage was built between 1850 and 1865.  While the date of construction listed in one source notes this possible time period as ranging from 1850-1880, the fact that it was being advertised for rental during the year 1865 means that it must have been built prior to that year.</p>
         <p>The first official record of ownership of Jersey Cottage dates to 1893 and to Johanna Renouf, the wife of Major William H. Renouf, a local politician who was Judge of the Central District of St.John's from 1874 onward. Major Renouf died in 1880. His connection to the property is unclear, but according to the advertisement in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, it was Johanna Renouf and not he, who was in control of the property or who at least handled the administrative details of the property rental prior to his death. 
         <p>Johanna Renouf died sometime prior to 1st May, 1893, at which time the property was leased by the executors of her estate to a Mr. Thomas Kent. On 19th may, 1898, the property was sold to the solicitor Frank Lilly, for the amount of $3,200. In 1914, the property was sold to the Stanley brothers, and it appears to have stayed within the Stanley family at least until 1974 and possibly until it was demolished, which occurred at some point after this year.</p>
